 The Qt Company LGPL Exception version 1.1:
 As an additional permission to the GNU Lesser General Public License version

 material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may distribute
 such object code under terms of your choice, provided that:

           templates; and

           Public License version 2.1.

 provided that such modification does not involve copying material from the
 Library into the modified Library's header files unless such material is
 limited to (i) numerical parameters; (ii) data structure layouts;
 (iii) accessors; and (iv) small macros, templates and inline functions of
 five lines or less in length.
